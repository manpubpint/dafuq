Drinking Administrators Frequently Unasked Questions

(aka a mish-mash of HOWTO / RFC / FAQ )

This is a brain dump describing what's involved in buying a round for a couple of hundred people. Organising a successful pub social takes a lot of running around in the background, especially if it's being funded by someone else. If it goes wrong, you can look very stupid. Make it go right.


Authors: Drinking Man, and hopefully others as time goes on.

-------

Drinking Man says: If anyone ever asked me how I organise a social, I'd point them at this project. Nobody has asked as yet, hence the Unasked in the title.

None of this stuff is particularly difficult, it's just much easier to have a reference to check against so you don't miss anything. It's basically my process behind the London Perl Workshop post-conference social, which has generally worked since 2011 and has been responsible for many hangovers.


(Right now, the first draft of the document is with my editor, to remove any grandma errors, but it'll be up in this repo shortly. Watch this space)
