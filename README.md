Drinking Administrators Frequently Unasked Questions

(aka a mish-mash of HOWTO / RFC / FAQ )

This is a brain dump describing what's involved in buying a round for a couple of hundred people. Organising a successful pub social takes a lot of running around in the background, especially if it's being funded by someone else. If it goes wrong, you can look very stupid. So make it go right.


Authors: Drinking Man, and hopefully others as time goes on.


First edit and proofread (before GitHub got its hands on it): A shade of purple.

Contents:

dafuq.txt - the howto itself. git clone, or cut and paste, and print or mail to yourself. Whichever works for you.

spec.txt - an example specification of your social's requirements, as described in DAFUQ. Hack it to bits according to your needs, and print multiple copies.

Drinking Man says: If anyone ever asked me how I organise a social, I'd point them at this project. Nobody has asked as yet, hence the Unasked in the title.

None of this stuff is particularly difficult, it's just much easier to have a reference to check against so you don't miss anything. It's basically my process behind the London Perl Workshop post-conference social, which has generally worked since 2011 and has been responsible for many hangovers.
